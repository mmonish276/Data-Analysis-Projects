# NMC-LCO 18650 Battery Lifespan & Lifecycle (Failure) Analysis

Utilized predictive analysis methods to pre-process & extrapolate the cycle/time that Lithium Ion batteries would reach failure. Larger versions of these batteries are used in various electric vehicles, but the batteries studied here were strictly of commercial-grade.
